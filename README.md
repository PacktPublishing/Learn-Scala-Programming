**Learn how to write scalable and concurrent programs in Scala, a language that grows with you. **

## What is this book about?
Scala is a general-purpose programming language that supports both functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. Due to its concise design and versatility, Scala's applications have been extended to a wide variety of fields such as data science and cluster computing. You will learn to write highly scalable, concurrent, and testable programs to meet everyday software requirements.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Get to know the reasons for choosing Scala: its use and the advantages it provides over other languages 
Bring together functional and object-oriented programming constructs to make a manageable application 
Master basic to advanced Scala constructs 
Test your applications using advanced testing methodologies such as TDD 
Select preferred language constructs from the wide variety of constructs provided by Scala 
Make the transition from the object-oriented paradigm to the functional programming paradigm
